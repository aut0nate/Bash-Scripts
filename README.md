## OpenAI API

### **`linux-assistant.sh`**

This script allows users to interact with an AI-powered Linux assistant that can answer Linux-related questions, provide troubleshooting guidance, and generate example scripts.

**Model Information:**

- The script uses **OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT** model, specifically `gpt-4o-mini` by default.
- Users can modify the script to use a different model by changing the `"model"` value in the API request.
- For more information on OpenAI models and API usage, refer to the [OpenAI Development Platform Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

**System Prompt:**

>You are a knowledgeable Linux assistant. You will only answer Linux-related questions, including topics such as commands, system administration, shell scripting, troubleshooting, networking, and kernel-related concepts. Your goal is to provide clear, concise, and accurate guidance suitable for a technical professional who is learning Linux. Always format command-line examples in proper code blocks using triple backticks, and include brief explanations when appropriate. If the user asks for a script, provide a complete example, and use code blocks for clarity.

**Features:**

- Supports a wide range of Linux topics, including:
  - Commands
  - System administration
  - Shell scripting
  - Troubleshooting
  - Networking
  - Kernel-related concepts
- Formats responses in proper code blocks.
- Includes error handling for missing API keys, empty input, and API request failures.

**Usage:**

1. Set your OpenAI API key by editing the `API_KEY` variable in the script.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./linux-assistant.sh
   ```

3. Ask your Linux assistant a question.

## System

### **`cpu-memory-usage.sh`**

This script displays the current CPU and memory usage in a simple and readable format. It uses standard Linux utilities like top, grep, awk, and free to retrieve and format the system information.

**Features:**

- CPU Usage: Displays the combined user and system CPU usage percentage.
- Memory Usage: Shows the used memory and total memory in human-readable format.

**Usage:**

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
    ./cpu-memory-usage.sh
   ```

2. Example output:

> CPU Usage:
15.7%
Memory Usage:
2.3G/8.0G

## Network

### **`public-ip-check.sh`**

This script retrieves your system's public IP address and includes basic error handling to inform you if the IP cannot be retrieved.

**Features:**

- **Public IP Detection**: Queries `https://ifconfig.me` to determine your public IP address.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles situations where the IP cannot be retrieved (e.g. no internet connection).

**Usage:**

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./public-ip-check.sh

2. Example output (successful):

> Your public IP is: 203.0.113.42

Example output (failure):

> Failed to retrieve public IP.
